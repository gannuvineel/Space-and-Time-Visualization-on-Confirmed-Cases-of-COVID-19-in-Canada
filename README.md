# Space and Time Visualization on Confirmed Cases of COVID-19 in Canada

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic in recent times. The virus, which was initially identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, 
has now spread across the world. Many people are being affected and infected by this disease. It is now a cause for a large number of deaths across 
the world. The common symptoms of the disease include dry cough, fever, and respiratory problems. Coughing and sneezing can result in the transmission 
of disease. According to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), more than 17 million people are
affected by this pandemic and more than half a million people have lost their lives. As per the Government of Canada website, more than 1 lakh people
are affected by this disease and around 8500 people have been dead.

The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is one of the health agencies of the Government of Canada that promotes and protects the health of Canadians. 
The responsibilities of PHAC include infectious control and prevention, health promotion, emergency preparedness, immunization and vaccines. 
PHAC started collecting the data related to COVID-19 from various sources and is closely monitoring the situation of COVID-19. The data collected by 
PHAC is in a tabular format which is difficult to visualize and identify the patterns. Thus, the target users of my project are the members of 
The Public Health Agency of Canada who can use the visualized data of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada and make informed decisions.
